      "text":"The S130 phosphorylation site of p21 is not conserved in p27 and p57. Nevertheless, S130 phosphorylation of p21 has been proposed      as the functional homologue of T187 phosphorylation of p27     ,      and T310 phosphorylation of p57     . S130 phosphorylation of p21 has been reported to be similarly catalyzed by CDK2 to form a phosphodegron recognized by the SCF/Skp2 ubiquitin ligase complex and to signal the proteasomal degradation of cyclin/CDK-bound p21 required for S-phase entry     -    . It was also found to be essential for release of a p21-imposed G1 arrest     . Here we show for the first time that this phosphorylation is abundant in total and CDK4-bound p21 during G1 phase, indicating that it does not rapidly lead to p21 degradation at this stage, possibly because Skp2 levels are kept low in G1 by proteasomal degradation initiated by APCCdh1     . Whereas most active cyclin D-CDK4 complexes are associated with p21 in G1-phase HCT116 cells, CDK7 inhibition reduced S130 phosphorylation and further increased or stabilized the binding of p21 to these complexes. In agreement with previous reports, such increased stoichiometry     ,     , and/or stability    , of p21 binding is likely sufficient to explain the impaired T172 phosphorylation and activity of CDK4 complexes and their refractoriness to in vitro activation by CAK. Mutations of the S130 residue and in vitro phosphorylation indeed suggested that this phosphorylation can reduce the stoichiometry or stability of p21 binding to CDK4 complexes, resulting in increased T172 phosphorylation of p21-bound CDK4. Interestingly, T187 phosphorylation of p27 also facilitates its release from cyclin E-CDK2 complexes     . At later time points, inhibition of S130 phosphorylation likely also explains the increased accumulation of p21 in response to CDK7 inhibition, in agreement with previous studies     -    . This too might suffice to prevent phosphorylation and activation of CDK4 complexes, as observed in response to proteasome inhibition by MG132. ",

Serum stimulation and CDK2 inhibition by CR8 in HCT116 K7AS cells has little effect on the composition and activity of CAK (cyclin H-CDK7-MAT1) complexes (A) and phosphorylation profile of CDK7 (B). (A,B) K7AS cells were stimulated or not stimulated (cont) with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 5 h in the absence or presence of CR8 as in          . (A) The activity of co-immunoprecipitated cyclin H-CDK7 complexes (cyc H IP) from these cells was evaluated on CDK4 complexes used a substrate. In this assay, these cyclin H-CDK7 complexes were mixed and incubated with ATP and inactive (dephosphorylated by lambda-phosphatase) cyclin D3-CDK4-HA complexes produced and immunoprecipitated from transfected CHO cells     . The resulting activation of the cyclin D3-CDK4-HA complexes was then assayed by their pRb-kinase activity. The mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. We detected cyclin H (cyc H) and CDK7, T170-phosphorylated CDK7, MAT1 and XPD co-immunoprecipitated by the cyclin H antibody from K7AS cells, and the presence of the substrate, i.e. cyclin D3-CDK4-HA complexes from CHO cells (CDK4-HA), and its in vitro activation reflected by the T826 phosphorylation of the pRb fragment (pRb-kinase). (B) Phosphorylation profiles of CDK7. Same cell lysates as in (A) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-CDK7 or anti-cyclin H (cyc H) and separated by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by immunodetection by antibodies directed against CDK7 or T170-phosphorylated CDK7 (P-CDK7 (T170)). As deduced from computed isoelectric points      and detection by the T170-phosphospecific antibody, arrowheads and arrows indicate singly and doubly phosphorylated CDK7 forms, respectively.

      "text":"Author Summary In the cell cycle, duplication of all the cellular components and subsequent cell division are governed by a family of protein kinases associated with cyclins (CDKs). Related CDK4 and CDK6 bound to cyclins D are the first CDKs to be activated in response to cell proliferation signals. They thus play a central role in the cell multiplication decision, especially in most cancer cells in which CDK4 activity is highly deregulated. We have identified the activating T172 phosphorylation instead of cyclin D expression as the highly regulated step determining CDK4 activation. This finding contrasts with the prevalent view that the only identified metazoan CDK-activating kinase, CDK7, is constitutively active. By using human cells genetically engineered for specific chemical inhibition of CDK7, we found that CDK7 activity was indeed required for CDK4 activation. However, this dependence was conditioned by CDK4 binding to the CDK inhibitory protein p21, which increased in response to CDK7 inhibition. Further investigation revealed that CDK7 inhibition affects a major phosphorylation of p21, which we found to be required for CDK4 activation and performed by CDK4 itself and CDK2. Thus, depending on CDK7 activity, CDK4 and CDK2 facilitate CDK4 activation, generating novel positive feedbacks involved in the cell cycle decision. ",

Arrows, T172-phosphorylated form of CDK4. Different exposures are shown for the different time points to better visualize the proportion of the CDK4 phosphorylated form irrespective of the relative amount of cyclin D-CDK4 complexes. In K7AS HCT116 (K7AS), DNA synthesis started to increase between 6 and 8 h after stimulation and peaked at 12-16 h             . As readout of CDK4 and CDK6 activity, T826 phosphorylation of pRb was first observed to increase at 3 h and peaked at 16 h             . Cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 expression was first seen to increase at 2 h. Whereas cyclin D1 accumulation peaked at 6 h, cyclin D3 continued to accumulate during S and G2 phases until 24 h. CDK4 and CDK6 expression was much less modulated             . Interestingly, the phosphorylation of cyclin D1-bound CDK4 appeared at 2-3 h into G1 phase, whereas the phosphorylation of cyclin D3-bound CDK4 was already detected in serum-deprived cells and further increased much later at 12 h and subsequent time points, when most cells were in S-G2 phases             . This suggests that CDK4 complexed to cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 might have partially different roles in the different cell cycle phases. The activating T160 phosphorylation of CDK2 was observed to increase at 4-6 h, along with an increased accumulation of cyclin E and a migration shift of this protein (likely associated with its CDK2-dependent phosphorylation     ). This coincided with the partial disappearance of p21 and p27, which reappeared at later time points (20-24 h)             . ",

As previously shown     , 1-NMPP1 prevented the induction of DNA synthesis in K7AS but not in wt HCT116 cells            . This was associated with a similar inhibition of the stimulated T826 phosphorylation of pRb in K7AS but not in wt cells, without any inhibition of the accumulation of cyclin D1, cyclin D3 or CDK4                        . Instead, cyclin D1 accumulation increased further at 8 and 16 h in response to CDK7 inhibition in K7AS cells             , likely due to impairment of the degradation it undergoes during S-phase progression. Serum-stimulated T160 phosphorylation of CDK2 was also inhibited only in K7AS cells, as previously demonstrated     .

Using 2D gel separations, we show that the in vitro phosphorylation of p21 by cyclin E/A-CDK2 occurs mainly at S130 but also at S98 (a residue reported to be phosphorylated by ASK1 and JNK1 but not CDKs     ), and we show for the first time that cyclin D-CDK4/6 also readily phosphorylate S130. Like p27 in cyclin E-CDK2 complexes     , p21 is thus both a potential inhibitor and a substrate of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes. Interestingly, S130 was more efficiently phosphorylated by the different CDK complexes when p21 was bound to cyclin D-CDK4. This, together with two other observations, suggests that p21 is not phosphorylated merely via an autonomous \"intra-complex\" mechanism. First, binding to inactive CDK4 complexes similarly increased the S130 phosphorylation of p21 in transfected CHO cells            . Second, S130 phosphorylation did not appear after incubation of p21-cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes with high ATP concentrations but no other kinase            . p21 as a subunit of the CDK4 complex would thus be phosphorylated, and hence regulated, by other active CDK4 and CDK2 complexes. As for CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of p21 on S130 in vitro     , deletion of the C-terminal Cy2 cyclin-binding site much reduced p21 phosphorylation in HCT116 cells             , suggesting that in cyclin D/CDK4-bound p21 the interaction with other active cyclin-CDK complexes to phosphorylate S130 is mediated by the Cy2 site. In intact HCT116 and CHO cells, the involvement of both CDK4 and CDK2 in S130 phosphorylation was further established by its inhibition in response to increased p21 expression, inhibition of CDK4/6 by PD0332991, and/or inhibition of CDKs by roscovitine and CR8 (which do not directly inhibit CDK4 activity). CR8 did not inhibit CDK7 activity in these experiments and thus most likely acted by inhibiting CDK2. In all those situations, much reduced T172 phosphorylation and activity of p21-bound CDK4 were associated with the inhibition of p21 S130 phosphorylation. To our knowledge, this is the first indication that CDK2 might control CDK4 activation. ",

To ascertain the possible involvement of CDK2 in S130 phosphorylation of p21 and hence in CDK4 activation, we first stimulated K7AS HCT116 cells in the presence or absence of the specific CDK inhibitor roscovitine, which in vitro inhibits several CDKs but not CDK4 and CDK6     . Using a concentration of R-roscovitine (20 microM) that has little effect on cell cycle and survival in CDK2-null MEFs     , we observed a strong inhibition of pRb phosphorylation, including at the T826 CDK4/6-specific site. The effect was already observed in G1 phase (5 h after stimulation), and at that time it was not associated with any major changes in the expression of p21                                                                                      .

HCT116 K7AS cells were co-transfected using expression plasmids encoding cyclin D3 and HA-tagged CDK4 in the continuous presence or absence of 1-NMPP1. The HA-tag allowed us to distinguish endogenous and ectopic CDK4 after 2D gel separation from the same co-immunoprecipitations. As shown in          , cyclin D3-bound CDK4-HA was more phosphorylated than endogenous CDK4, and unlike endogenous CDK4, its phosphorylation was largely resistant to CDK7 inhibition. However, in the minor fraction of CDK4-HA that could be co-immunoprecipitated through its binding to endogenous p21 (using a p21 antibody), we observed a partial but marked reduction of CDK4 phosphorylation after CDK7 inhibition by 1-NMPP1            . Therefore, we reasoned that the higher T172 phosphorylation level and its resistance to CDK7 inhibition seen in most ectopic cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes might have been due to their overexpression, which allows them to assemble without being stabilized by the endogenous p21, which was not present in sufficient amounts.

HCT116 K7AS cells were stimulated (+) or not stimulated (-) with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 5 h in the absence or presence of the following inhibitors: roscovitine (rosco), 1-NMPP1, CR8 or a combination of 1-NMPP1 and CR8. Western blotting analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies from whole-cell lysates. To evaluate the impact of R-roscovitine and CR8 on CDK7 in          experiments, we compared their effect to specific inhibition of CDK7 by 1-NMPP1 on phosphorylations of C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Previous studies in K7AS HCT116 cells have shown that CTD S5 phosphorylation is performed by both CDK7 and CDK9, whereas CTD S2 might be an exclusive CDK9 substrate     ,     . As previously shown     , CDK7 inhibition by 1-NMPP1 was insufficient to affect CTD S5 and S2 phosphorylations. By contrast, roscovitine inhibited both phosphorylations, whereas CR8 inhibited only, but completely, S2 phosphorylation, confirming its inhibitory impact on CDK9     . Interestingly, 1-NMPP1 did abrogate S5 phosphorylation in the presence of CR8 (A). This confirmed that inhibition of CTD S5 phosphorylation requires combined inhibition of both CDK7 and CDK9, and also implies that CR8 did not affect CDK7 activity. Overall, we concluded that, in addition to strong CDK2 inhibition, roscovitine reduced CDK7 and CDK9 activities, whereas CR8 inhibited CDK2 and CDK9 but not CDK7. Effect of roscovitine on phosphorylations of p21 and CDK4 thus most likely resulted from inhibition of both CDK2 and CDK7, whereas CR8 acted only through CDK2 inhibition. (B) The effect of CDK2 inhibition by CR8 on CDK4 phosphorylation is delayed compared to its abrupt disappearance resulting from CDK7 inhibition. HCT116 K7AS cells were stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 5 h and roscovitine (rosco), CR8 or 1-NMPP1 were added or not added for 1 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-cyclin D1 (D1), anti-cyclin D3 (D3) or anti-p21 antibodies and separated by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by CDK4 immunodetection. ",

      "text":"Unlike cyclin D3-CDK6, CDK4 complexes from CDK7-inhibited cells are refractory to in vitro phosphorylation by CAK. HCT116 K7AS cells were stimulated (+) or not stimulated (-) with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 5 h in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 1-NMPP1. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-cyclin D1 (D1), anti-cyclin D3 (D3) or anti-p21 antibodies and incubated with ATP in the presence (+) or absence (-) of recombinant cyclin H-CDK7-MAT1 complex (CAK). The complexes were then separated by 2D gel electrophoresis and immunodetected with a mixture of anti-CDK4 and anti-CDK6 antibodies. In the inset, as a positive control of CAK activity in the same experiment, immunoprecipitated (D3 IP) cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes from CHO cells transfected with plasmids encoding cyclin D3 and CDK4-HA were pretreated or not with lambda-phosphatase (lambda PPase) and then incubated with ATP with or without CAK, before 2D gel electrophoresis and CDK4 immunodetection. Arrows indicate the position of T172/T177-phosphorylated form of CDK4/6. If the impaired activation of CDK4 and CDK6 complexes in CDK7-inhibited K7AS cells was due only to absence of activating phosphorylation, these complexes should remain phosphorylatable by CAK in vitro, as observed here using cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes produced in CHO cells (inset). By contrast, only cyclin D3-CDK6, but neither cyclin D3-CDK4, cyclin D1-CDK4 nor cyclin D1-CDK6, was phosphorylated by CAK from 1-NMPP1-treated cells. This refractoriness to CAK activation of cyclin D3-CDK4 from CDK7-inhibited cells might have been due to its increased association with p21            . Indeed, p21-bound CDK4 and CDK6 (which in part were associated with cyclin D3) from CDK7-inhibited cells were also refractory to phosphorylation by CAK. Consistently, the observation that only cyclin D3-CDK6 but not cyclin D3-CDK4 from CDK7-inhibited cells could be activated by CAK is likely explained by the weaker binding, and hence relative resistance, of cyclin D3-CDK6 complexes to p21     . Unexpectedly, irrespective of the cell treatment by serum or 1-NMPP1, none of the cyclin D1 complexes could be re-activated by CAK in these experiments. Others have also observed that only cyclin D3-CDK6 but neither cyclin D1-CDK6 nor cyclin D1-CDK4 could be activated by CAK in vitro     . As T-loop phosphorylation of CDK7 might be more important for its recognition of S/T-P motifs (as found in CDK4 and most non-CDK substrates of CDK7)     , we also verified that the recombinant CDK7 was largely phosphorylated at T170 using 2D-gel electrophoresis combined with a T170-phosphospecific antibody (data not shown).

CDK4 phosphorylation is a central node integrating oncogenic signaling cascades, as its abrogation requires combined inhibition of the Ras/MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways     . But amazingly, it is also inhibited by various CDK inhibitors that were not suspected to affect CDK4 activity, including roscovitine (Seliciclib), and drugs that increase p21 levels, including proteasome inhibitors, such as Bortezomib. In p53-proficient cells, genotoxic therapeutic drugs and treatments, which induce large amounts of p21, are thus also expected to inhibit CDK4 phosphorylation. The resulting inhibition of CDK4 activity may halt cell proliferation in pRb-proficient tumors. On the other hand, p21-dependent inhibition of CDK4 activation might also explain the stronger resistance of pRb-proficient cells to the apoptotic effect of these different treatments, which might be exploited to protect normal cells and hence allow more aggressive treatments of pRb-deficient tumors     ,     . Finally, the novel positive feedback pathways identified here from CDK4 and CDK2 to facilitate CDK4 activation may explain the relative resistance to receptor or cell signaling kinase inhibitory drugs of cancer cells that have intrinsically strong CDK4 activity (e.g. due to frequent CDKN2A deletion or Cdk4 amplification) and/or CDK2 activity (e.g. due to deregulation of cyclin E). This would provide a rationale for treatments that combine inhibitory drugs targeting oncogenic signaling pathways and CDKs, as suggested recently     . ",

(A) In the context of K domain T57D mutation, S130D phosphomimetic mutation of p21 weakens p21 binding to CDK4 and increases phosphorylation of the remaining CDK4 bound to p21. Stably infected HCT116 K7AS cells for Tet-On inducible 3xHA-p21 wt or indicated mutants were treated with doxycycline (1 microg/ml) for 16 h prior to cell restimulation with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 16 h in the continuous presence of doxycycline. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody and separated by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by simultaneous immunodetection of ectopic 3xHA-p21 and 3xHA-p21-bound endogenous CDK4 using a mixture of anti-CDK4 and p21 antibodies. (B) Phosphorylation of p21 by cyclin A-CDK2 potentially modifies the interaction of p21 with cyclin D-CDK4 to increase the accessibility of CDK4 T172 to CAK. Stably infected HCT116 K7AS cells allowing doxycycline-inducible HA-p21 wt or T57D mutant expression were serum-deprived for 48 h and treated with doxycycline (1 microg/ml) during 16 h. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA (HA) antibody and incubated first with ATP with or without recombinant cyclin A2-CDK2 and then with ATP with or without recombinant cyclin H-CDK7-MAT1 (CAK). The proteins were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by simultaneous immunodetection of ectopic 3xHA-p21 and 3xHA-p21-bound endogenous CDK4 using a mixture of anti-CDK4 and p21 antibodies. Right panels in (A,B) are CDK4 enlargements with adjustment of exposure times to facilitate comparison of the proportion of the phosphorylated form (arrows). Colored arrows in (B) indicate phosphorylated forms of p21. The experiment in            suggested that S130 phosphorylation of p21 may somehow weaken its interaction with cyclin D-CDK4 complexes, allowing CDK4 phosphorylation by CAK or another kinase. As no previous study has reported that S130 phosphorylation could be mimicked by the S130D mutation (unlike the homologous T187D mutation of p27), we wanted to evaluate whether in vitro phosphorylation of p21-cyclin-CDK4 complexes by CDK2 might more efficiently affect them and the capacity of p21-bound CDK4 to be phosphorylated by CAK. As shown in           , codetection of p21 and CDK4 after in vitro phosphorylation by cyclin A2-CDK2 and/or CAK revealed that (i) cyclin A2-CDK2 phosphorylated p21 at S130, S98 and another unidentified site (lane3; as previously observed in           . Of note, CAK also phosphorylated p21 at another unidentified site (not S130, T57 or S98 as demonstrated by different migration; lane 2); (ii) phosphorylation of wt p21 by cyclin A2-CDK2 did not affect CDK4 co-immunoprecipitation and did not appreciably increase subsequent phosphorylation of p21-bound CDK4 by CAK (lane 4); (iii) however, in the T57D mutation context, phosphorylation by cyclin A2-CDK2 much reduced CDK4 interaction with p21 (lane 7), allowing complete phosphorylation by CAK of the remaining p21-bound CDK4 (lane 8).

Stably infected HCT116 K7AS cells for Tet-On inducible 3xHA-p21 wt or DeltaCy2 (aa 1 to 154) mutant were treated with doxycycline (1 microg/ml) for 16 h prior cell restimulation with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 16 h in the continuous presence of doxycycline. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody and separated by 2D gel electrophoresis followed by simultaneous immunodetection of ectopic 3xHA-p21 and 3xHA-p21-bound endogenous CDK4 using a mixture of anti-CDK4 and p21 antibodies. Black arrow, T172-phosphorylated CDK4. Colored arrows indicate phosphorylated forms of p21. Black arrowheads indicate the unphosphorylated form of wt and DeltaCy2 p21. Of note, deletion of the 10 C-terminal aminoacids (including the Cy2 motif) much modifies the isoelectric point of p21 (computed isoelectric points of 3xHA-p21 and its DeltaCy2 mutant are 7.63 and 5.61, respectively). This explains why the phosphorylated forms are much less separated in the DeltaCy2 mutant, which also precludes the formal identification of these forms (the form indicated by a blue arrow is putatively phosphorylated on S98).

      "text":"We next wanted to identify the phosphorylation sites of p21 in K7AS cells. Different phosphorylated forms of a protein present characteristic reproducible migrations in 2D gel separations, which allows them to be monitored once they are identified     . As the phosphorylations of p21 depended on CDK7 activity, we hypothesize that they could have been catalyzed by CDKs, which phosphorylate S/T-P motifs. p21 contains three such motifs (T57, S98, S130). So we produced human p21 and its T57A, S98A and S130A mutants in CHO cells, and compared their 2D gel separation patterns after in vitro phosphorylation by active recombinant CDK complexes. In the same experiments, p21 was also produced as a complex with cyclin D3 and CDK4 (immunoprecipitated by the DCS-28 cyclin D3 antibody) to evaluate how the accessibility of p21 phosphorylation sites might have been affected. As analyzed in           and          , cyclin E1-CDK2 and cyclin D3-CDK4 phosphorylated unbound p21 at both S130 and S98 but not at T57 (the patterns were not affected by the T57A mutation), whereas only S130 was phosphorylated by cyclin A2-CDK2. In p21 complexed with cyclin D3 and CDK4, phosphorylation of S130 by cyclin E1-CDK2 and cyclin D3-CDK4 was more complete, while S98 phosphorylation was much reduced. By contrast, after incubation with cyclin A2-CDK2, cyclin D3/CDK4-bound p21 was more completely phosphorylated and several multi-phosphorylated forms appeared. The S130A mutation affected all the phosphorylated forms             . The multi-phosphorylated forms were similarly affected by the S98A mutation, whereas the T57A mutation had no effect             . Therefore, after phosphorylation by cyclin A2-CDK2, all phosphorylated forms of cyclin D3/CDK4-bound p21 contained the S130 phosphorylation, and its most abundant forms resulted from a combination of S130 and S98 phosphorylations associated with one or two unidentified phosphorylations (but not on T57)                       . In similar in vitro experiments, the association of p21 with cyclin D1-CDK4 was also required for its complete S130 phosphorylation by cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin D1-CDK6            . Overall, these observations suggest that interaction of p21 with cyclin D-CDK4 increases the accessibility of the S130 residue to the five recombinant active CDKs we tested, and the accessibility of S98 to cyclin A2-CDK2 only, while impairing S98 accessibility to cyclin E1-CDK2 and cyclin D1/D3-CDK4. CDK4 was not phosphorylated by recombinant CDK2 and CDK4 complexes in these experiments (not shown). ",

      "text":"Cell cycle progression, including genome duplication, is orchestrated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). CDK activation depends on phosphorylation of their T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the only known CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. Therefore, the critical activation step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc25 phosphatases rather than unrestricted T-loop phosphorylation. Homologous CDK4 and CDK6 bound to cyclins D are master integrators of mitogenic/oncogenic signaling cascades by initiating the inactivation of the central oncosuppressor pRb and cell cycle commitment at the restriction point. Unlike the situation in CDK1 and CDK2 cyclin complexes, and in contrast to the weak but constitutive T177 phosphorylation of CDK6, we have identified the T-loop phosphorylation at T172 as the highly regulated step determining CDK4 activity. Whether both CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylations are catalyzed by CDK7 remains unclear. To answer this question, we took a chemical-genetics approach by using analogue-sensitive CDK7(as/as) mutant HCT116 cells, in which CDK7 can be specifically inhibited by bulky adenine analogs. Intriguingly, CDK7 inhibition prevented activating phosphorylations of CDK4/6, but for CDK4 this was at least partly dependent on its binding to p21cip1. In response to CDK7 inhibition, p21-binding to CDK4 increased concomitantly with disappearance of the most abundant phosphorylation of p21, which we localized at S130 and found to be catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2. The S130A mutation of p21 prevented the activating CDK4 phosphorylation, and inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impaired phosphorylations of both p21 and p21-bound CDK4. Therefore, specific CDK7 inhibition revealed the following: a crucial but partly indirect CDK7 involvement in phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6; existence of CDK4-activating kinase(s) other than CDK7; and novel CDK7-dependent positive feedbacks mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2 to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage.

We have previously shown that the \"CDK4-mimicking\" S178P mutation of CDK6 dramatically increases its activity by inducing its almost complete T177 phosphorylation. Interestingly, phosphorylation of S178P CDK6 does not require cyclin binding (at variance with CDK4)     , and so it is not influenced by binding to a Cip/Kip protein, which requires prior association with a cyclin     . By lentiviral infection, we generated TetON-inducible K7AS cells that express Flag-tagged wt or S178P CDK6, with or without cyclin D3, in response to doxycycline            . In sharp contrast with wt Flag-CDK6, the induced Flag-S178P CDK6 was almost completely T177-phosphorylated, as shown by its previously characterized      2D gel separation            . The continuous presence of up to 30 microM of 1-NMPP1 to completely inhibit CDK7 activity during the induction by doxycycline only minimally affected the phosphorylation of S178P CDK6 expressed alone (without cyclin D3)            . By contrast, when S178P CDK6 was co-induced with cyclin D3 to allow its interaction with endogenous p21, inhibition of CDK6 phosphorylation was much more pronounced in the fraction of S178P CDK6 co-immunoprecipitated by the p21 antibody from CDK7-inhibited cells            , exactly as observed for p21-bound ectopic CDK4-HA            .

First, the unaffected phosphorylation of ectopic cyclin D3-CDK4 and S178P CDK6 during CDK7 inhibition, as well as the unaltered phosphorylation of endogenous p21-free CDK4 complexes, demonstrate that CDK7 cannot be the sole CDK4-activating kinase as previously postulated     ,     . While completing our study, it was reported that inactivation of Rb family proteins by a SV40 large T fragment restores T-loop phosphorylation of CDK2 and CDK1 despite genetic inactivation of CDK7     . That observation too shows the existence of non-CDK7 CAKs in mammalian cells. Second, in our experiments, the requirement for CDK7 activity appears to be restricted to p21-bound CDK4 (or S178P CDK6). One possible explanation is that p21 binding might be required to co-localize CDK4 in the nucleus with CDK7, the CAK activity of which depends on its nuclear targeting     . Outside the nucleus, ectopic cyclin D3-CDK4 and S178P CDK6 (which are mostly cytoplasmic     ) might be phosphorylated by other proline-directed kinase(s). Third, the requirement for CDK7 activity is complex and at least in part indirect. For example, it might be mediated by CDK2 and CDK4 activation and thus by S130 phosphorylation of cyclin D/CDK4-bound p21, as discussed below. Though the rapid effect of CDK7 inhibition on CDK4 phosphorylation indicates a direct involvement, it does not formally demonstrate it because CDK7 might conceivably act on other CDK4 kinases (or phosphatases). Fourth, CDK7 could still be the catalytic subunit of the regulated proline-directed CDK4-activating kinase that we postulated     . In vitro, cyclin H-CDK7-Mat1 phosphorylates CDK4 independently of its +1 proline     , and when coimmunoprecipitated from various cell lysates, it is constitutively active (even when assayed on CDK4)     -                 . Nevertheless, CDK7 might act differently in cells due to interaction with unknown accessory proteins that might not be preserved in CDK7 immunoprecipitations. Such regulated accessory proteins might mediate the complex regulations of CDK4 phosphorylation, including its differential regulation in cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 complexes     ,     . Even the possibility that CDK7 would not utilize cyclin H to activate CDK4 in cells cannot be excluded. ",

      "text":"Our data suggest that, depending on their activities during cell cycle progression, either CDK4 or CDK2 complexes can exert positive feedbacks to reduce the negative impact of p21 on CDK4 activation           . This could further amplify CDK4 activation and subsequently lead to increased degradation of p21, which in turn facilitates CDK2 activation. Our data indicate that p21 inhibitory activity can be deactivated inside the inhibited cyclin D-CDK4 complex by other active CDK4 complexes. If this can be verified, theoretical conditions would be met to generate a bistable biochemical system (see e.g.      for a mathematical discussion of the analogous deactivation of p27 by cyclin E-CDK2). In such a switch-like biochemical module, binary (all-or-none) activation of CDK4 could occur, and sustain its permissiveness to activation despite reduced mitogenic stimulation, once the threshold barrier imposed by the p21 inhibitory potential has been overcome     . The positive \"reverse\" feedback pathways from CDK4 and CDK2 to CDK4 activation proposed here for the first time would introduce the notion that not only the pRb-E2F switch    , but also its trigger, might be endowed with bistable properties that would contribute to explaining the irreversibility of the cell cycle commitment at the R point. This mechanism (or similar ones in p21-independent CDK4 activation as observed in cAMP-dependent cell cycle of thyrocytes     ,     ) can explain the exceptional robustness of the correlation between CDK4 T172 phosphorylation, pRb phosphorylation and subsequent S-phase entry that we have observed in all the cell models and regulations we studied.

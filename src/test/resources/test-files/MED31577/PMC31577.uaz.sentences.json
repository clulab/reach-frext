      "text":"While Rlk is phosphorylated similarly to Btk and Itk, there are marked differences between these two kinases. Perhaps the most obvious of these differences is the lack of the pleckstrin homology domain in Rlk. Data suggest that membrane association of Itk and Btk requires the interaction of their PH domains with products of PI3K, thereby facilitating phosphorylation by Src family kinases        . In contrast, we have recently demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors do not alter activation of Rlk by Fyn, suggesting that the requirements for activation of Rlk by Src family kinases are distinct from the other Tec kinases. It is also of note that we can reproducibly co-immunoprecipitate Rlk and Fyn, perhaps due to their association with RAFTs, whereas we have been unable to co-precipitate Itk with Src family kinases when co-expressed in 293T cells (data not shown), again demonstrating distinct properties of the Rlk protein compared to certain other members of the Btk family. The combination of similar and distinct features is further supported by the observation that TXK can rescue phospholipase C-gamma activation in BTK deficient DT40 cells, but fails to rescue a defect in apoptosis     .

Furthermore, activation of Jurkats appeared to be associated with a loss of Rlk from non-RAFT fractions (see Fig.    . Since phosphorylation of Rlk did not seem to affect association with RAFTs, we examined whether Fyn altered other properties of the Rlk protein. To start to address this issue, we measured the effect of Fyn on the protein stability of Rlk. Rlk was expressed in 293T cells, either in the absence or the presence of Fyn; the cells were labeled for 15 minutes with 35S methionine and cysteine, then incubated for increasing times with unlabelled methionine and cysteine. When expressed alone, labeled Rlk appeared stable in the detergent-soluble fraction for 90 minutes (Fig.   , top panel). When co-expressed with Fyn, however, Rlk disappeared from the soluble fraction at a significantly faster rate (Fig.   , lower panel, half-life between 30 and 60 minutes). The change in half-life was particularly noticeable for the larger form of Rlk. In the presence of kinase-inactive Fyn, the half-life of Rlk was not altered, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn is necessary for the decrease in half-life of Rlk (Fig.    . Similarly, co-transfection of wild type Fyn with RlkY420F did not alter the half-life of RlkY420F in the soluble fraction (data not shown), again arguing that phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn is required for this increased turnover in the soluble fraction.

Recent data argue that Itk interacts directly with Slp-76 and Grb2 to participate in a LAT-nucleated T cell signaling complex involved in PLC-gamma activation       . It will be of interest to examine the interactions of Rlk with other components of this complex. Indeed, the potential in vitro binding of the amino-terminus of Rlk to the SH3 domain of Grb2 hints of similar protein interactions. Thus, although Rlk appears to be distinct among the Tec kinases in the lack of a PH domain, the presence of a palmitoylated cysteine string and the existence of a shorter isoform that can localize to the nucleus, Rlk may contribute to similar signaling pathways. Indeed, our data suggest that the cysteine string may serve as a surrogate to the PH domain for targeting Rlk to RAFTs. It is also notable that recent data suggest that Btk can translocate to the nucleus upon B cell activation, similar to the nuclear translocation we have reported for Rlk        . Nonetheless, the PI3K independence of the activation of Rlk activation and its association with RAFTs suggests that Rlk may also have distinct contributions to these signaling pathways. ",

This phenomenon could result from either a change in protein location to a detergent-insoluble fraction or increased turnover of Rlk. Activation of tyrosine kinases and other signal transduction molecules is associated both with changes in subcellular distribution and with changes in protein stability. For example, crosslinking of the T-cell receptor results in a transition of the receptor complex to a detergent-insoluble fraction           , as well as to increased turnover of TCR components     . Nonetheless, the decreased half-life of Rlk in both detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions argues that activation of Rlk leads to increased degradation of the Rlk protein, similar to that observed for other components of the TCR complex, but not previously reported for Tec family kinases. The dependence of this increased turnover on phosphorylation of Rlk suggests that a phosphotyrosine-dependent association with another molecule may be required for this process, reminiscent of the increased degradation of the PDGF receptor and Syk caused by association with the ring-finger protein Cbl            or the Lck-dependent degradation of the TCR     .

For most Tec kinases, this activation requires an interaction between their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and the products of phosphoinositide 3-Kinase, which localizes Tec kinases to membrane RAFTs. Rlk/Txk is a Tec related kinase expressed in T cells that lacks a pleckstrin homology domain, having instead a palmitoylated cysteine-string motif. To evaluate Rlk's function in T cell receptor signaling cascades, we examined the requirements for Rlk localization and activation by Src family kinases. Results We demonstrate that Rlk is also associated with RAFTs, despite its lack of a pleckstrin homology domain. Rlk RAFT association requires the cysteine-string motif and is independent of PI3 Kinase activity. We further demonstrate that Rlk can be phosphorylated and activated by Src kinases, leading to a decrease in its half-life. A specific tyrosine in the activation loop of Rlk, Y420, is required for phosphorylation and activation, as well as for decreased stability, but is not required for lipid RAFT association. Mutation of this tyrosine also prevents increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Rlk after stimulation of the T cell receptor, suggesting that Rlk is phosphorylated by Src family kinases in response to T cell receptor engagement. Conclusions Like the other related Tec kinases, Rlk is associated with lipid RAFTs and can be phosphorylated and activated by Src family kinases, supporting a role for Rlk in signaling downstream of Src kinases in T cell activation.

However, consistent with the lack of a pleckstrin homology domain, activation of Rlk is independent of PI3K activity     . To further characterize the mechanism of activation of Rlk/Txk, we studied the nature of Rlk's localization and interaction with Src family kinases. We report here a physical association of Rlk with Fyn both in vitro and when co-expressed in 293T cells. Similar to Btk and Itk, we find that a conserved tyrosine in the activation loop of the Rlk kinase domain, Y420, mediates specificity for transphosphorylation of Rlk by Src family kinases. This tyrosine is also critical for in vivo activation of Rlk, since mutation of Y420 to phenylalanine (Y420F) reduces phosphorylation of Rlk upon co-expression with Fyn or after engagement of the TCR. Furthermore, we have observed that the phosphorylation of Rlk by Fyn increases Rlk turnover, consistent with the increased turnover observed with other TCR signaling molecules following activation. In contrast, localization of Rlk does not appear to rely on tyrosine phosphorylation or kinase activity of Rlk. Instead, we find a constitutive association of a fraction of the full-length Rlk with a detergent-insoluble RAFT fraction. Association with the RAFT compartment does not depend on tyrosine phosphorylation, nor on PI3K activation, but rather on the presence of the cysteine string motif. Thus, despite lacking a pleckstrin homology domain, Rlk is localized in RAFTs, is phosphorylated by Src family kinases, and may transduce signals downstream of Src family kinases during T cell activation.

This site corresponds to the location of the autophosphorylation site in the activation loop of Src-related kinases     . To determine whether this tyrosine is required for Rlk activation by Src family kinases, we mutated it to phenylalanine (Y420F). In contrast to WT Rlk-GFP, tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of the RlkY420F mutant was not significantly increased by co-expression with Fyn (Fig.       and data not shown). These results suggest that Y420 is a major site of phosphorylation by Fyn and that phosphorylation at this site leads to activation of the Rlk kinase. Furthermore, since baseline tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of the Y420F mutant is also lower than WT (Fig.    and data not shown), it is possible that phosphorylation by endogenous Src family kinases may contribute to the activity of Rlk in 293T cells, although we cannot exclude the possibility that this mutant lowers kinase activity for other reasons.

Our mutational analysis of Rlk supports a similar mechanism for activation of Rlk by Src family kinases downstream of the TCR. Rlk kinase activity is increased by Src family kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine, Y420, equivalent to Y551 in the activation loop of the kinase domain of Btk. Mutation of this site causes a reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Rlk, which is not substantially enhanced upon co-expression with Fyn or upon TCR stimulation. Thus, this Src kinase phosphorylation site appears to be important for activation after TCR stimulation. Mutation of a second tyrosine, equivalent to the putative autophosphorylation site of Btk, slightly reduces tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of Rlk. However, phosphorylation and kinase activity of this mutant still can be enhanced after co-expression with Fyn. Thus, despite its unique amino terminus, Rlk utilizes a transphosphorylation activation mechanism similar to other Btk family members. ",

The full-length isoform of Rlk also exhibits higher tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity than the short isoform. This differential phosphorylation does not appear to result solely from a distinct phosphorylation site on the full-length Rlk, since mutation of the only additional tyrosine found in the full-length Rlk (Y6) does not greatly reduce the phosphorylation or activity of Rlk when expressed either alone or in conjunction with Fyn. Instead, the increased phosphorylation may result in part from distinct properties of full-length Rlk. Indeed, we report here that the palmitoylated cysteine-string is responsible for the targeting of Rlk to RAFTs: detergent-insoluble, glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains that contain many signaling molecules, including Src family kinases. Our data may provide the first demonstration that a cysteine-string motif can lead to protein association with RAFTs. Of note, Itk and Btk have been found to be associated with lipid RAFTs upon activation of antigen receptors        . However, the association of Itk with RAFTs requires its PH domain and is dependent on the products of PI3K. Indeed, in Jurkat cells, which are deficient in the inositol phophatase PTEN, Itk is constitutively associated with the membrane unless the cells are treated with inhibitors of PI3K or transfected with PTEN     . In contrast, we have found that Rlk association with RAFTs, like its activation by Src family kinases, is PI3K independent. Thus, although Rlk, like Itk and Btk, is activated by phosphorylation by Src family kinases and can be found in RAFTs, its requirements for this activation may be unique. ",

Instead, we have found that the rlk gene encodes a distinctive palmitoylated cysteine-string motif near its amino-terminus. Furthermore, we have found that an internal translational start-site, downstream of the region encoding the cysteine-string motif, gives rise to a second isoform that lacks the palmitoylated cysteine string and that can be localized in the nucleus     . Although these distinctive features suggest that Rlk may have atypical functions, Rlk shares with Btk kinases the homologous proline-rich motif that binds the SH3 domains of Src kinases and the tyrosines at equivalent sites in the SH3 and kinase domains.

      "text":"Engagement of antigen receptors on lymphocytes leads to the rapid sequential activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, including well-studied members of the Src and the ZAP-70/Syk families      . Recently, the Tec kinases have also been implicated as important components of signaling from antigen and other lymphocyte cell surface receptors (reviewed in        .) This subfamily includes six members: Btk, Tec, Itk/Tsk/Emt, Bmx/Emt, Dsrc29, and Rlk/Txk        . The importance of the Tec kinases in antigen receptor signaling was first demonstrated by the observation that mutations in BTK result in the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) and the murine counterpart X-linked immunodeficiency (xid). These severe B cell immunodeficiencies are characterized by diminished numbers of mature B cells and reduced immunoglobulin levels associated with impaired PLC-gamma activation and Ca++ mobilization in response to surface IgM stimulation (sIgM)            . Btk kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation increase upon stimulation of sIgM as well as the IL-5 and IL6 receptors in B cells, and upon crosslinking of the high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRII) in mast cells              . It is now clear that the other Tec kinases participate in similar signaling cascades in multiple cell-types. Itk, a Tec family kinase that is predominantly expressed in T cells, is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated after stimulation of either the T cell receptor (TCR) or CD28 in T cell lines, and FcepsilonRII in mast cells              . Recently, we have found that Rlk/Txk can also be phosphorylated after TCR engagement     . Furthermore, we have found that combined mutation of Rlk and Itk leads to profound defects in TCR signaling associated with impaired activation of PLC-gamma     . Such data suggest that members of this family may function similarly in signaling pathways downstream from these cell surface antigen receptors. ",

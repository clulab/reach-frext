      "text":"Inhibition of microglial inflammatory responses by norepinephrine: effects on nitric oxide and interleukin-1beta production .      Background.  Under pathological conditions, microglia produce proinflammatory mediators which contribute to neurologic damage, and whose levels can be modulated by endogenous factors including neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine (NE). We investigated the ability of NE to suppress microglial activation, in particular its effects on induction and activity of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) and the possible role that IL-1beta plays in that response.    Results.  LPS caused a time-dependent increase in NOS2 mRNA levels and NO production; which was blocked by a selective NFkappaB inhibitor. NE dose-dependently reduced NOS2 expression and NO generation, via activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs), and reduced loss of inhibitory IkBalpha protein. NE effects were replicated by dibutyryl-cyclic AMP. However, co-incubation with either PKA or AC inhibitors did not reverse suppressive effects of NE, but instead reduced nitrite production. A role for IL-1beta was suggested since NE potently blocked microglial IL-1beta production. However, incubation with a caspase-1 inhibitor, which reduced IL-1beta levels, had no effect on NO production; incubation with IL-receptor antagonist had biphasic effects on nitrite production; and NE inhibited nitrite production in caspase-1 deficient microglia.    Conclusions.  NE reduces microglial NOS2 expression and IL-1beta production, however IL-1beta does not play a critical role in NOS2 induction nor in mediating NE suppressive effects. Changes in magnitude or kinetics of cAMP may modulate NOS2 induction as well as suppression by NE. These results suggest that dysregulation of the central cathecolaminergic system may contribute to detrimental inflammatory responses and brain damage in neurological disease or trauma.      Introduction.  Microglial activation including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species is now recognized as a key component of several neurological diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD); as well as other conditions in which trauma, infection, or injury leads to inflammatory activation. Activated microglia produce the free radical NO synthesized by the inducible form of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2). NOS2 can be induced in enriched cultures of microglial cells upon treatment with proinflammatory cytokines or bacterial endotoxin [XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR], as well as in rodent brains following peripheral or intraparenchymal introduction of inflammatory inducers [XREF_BIBR]. In some cases NOS2 expression was dependent upon IL1beta production [XREF_BIBR], and some anti-inflammatory treatments were shown to reduce both microglial IL-1beta as well as NOS2 expression ([XREF_BIBR] for review). However other studies reported distinct, and in some cases opposite effects of anti-inflammatory treatments upon IL-1beta versus NOS2 expression [XREF_BIBR]. Thus, the precise role for IL-1beta in regulating NOS2 expression in microglia requires further study.  We demonstrated that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) prevents induction of NOS2 in rat cortical astrocytes [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR], and more recently in vivo that depletion of NE exacerbates the cortical inflammatory response to amyloid beta (Abeta) [XREF_BIBR]. Similarly, others have shown that NE reduces astroglial expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL1beta and TNFalpha [XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR] and of cell adhesion molecules [XREF_BIBR]. The effects of NE appear to involve activation of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) and elevation of intracellular cAMP, and in most cases lead to suppression of astrocytic inflammatory responses [XREF_BIBR]. Perturbation in NE levels, or dysfunction in NE signaling might therefore exacerbate inflammatory responses and thus contribute to neurological damage, for example in AD and Parkinson's disease where noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are lost [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR], or in MS where astrocytic beta-AR expression is reduced [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR].  Rat cortical microglia express all different types of ARs [XREF_BIBR], and treatment with NE results in increased levels of cAMP within the cells which can be inhibited by the beta-AR non selective antagonist propanol [XREF_BIBR]. However the cellular effects of NE on microglial inflammatory responses are less well characterized. NE reduced NO production in N9 microglial cells [XREF_BIBR] and in rat microglia [XREF_BIBR], but increased IL-1beta mRNA in rat microglia [XREF_BIBR]. Other agents which increase microglial cAMP (analogs such as dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (dbcAMP), activators of adenylate cyclase (AC), or PGE2) also modulate inflammatory responses, however in contrast to astrocytes, both up as well as down regulation of NOS2 and IL-1beta has been observed [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR]. Since the regulation of microglial NOS2 differs from astroglial NOS2 [XREF_BIBR] it is not surprising that anti-inflammatory treatments which attenuate astrocyte NOS2 or IL-1beta may have distinct actions in microglial cells.  To better understand how NE reduces microglial inflammatory responses, we examined the effects of NE on NOS2 expression in rat cortical microglial cells. We observed that, as found for astrocytes, NE dose-dependently blocked microglial NOS2 expression, via beta2-ARs activation. In the same cells, NE more potently reduced IL-1beta production, reaching close to 100% attenuation at low concentrations of NE (1 to 10 muM). However, additional experiments suggest that while NE inhibits both these factors, the suppression of NOS2 expression is not directly due to the reduction of IL-1beta levels. These findings indicate that, at least in vitro, microglial NOS2 expression is not dependent upon IL-1beta production and therefore suggest that anti-inflammatory treatments designed to reduce IL-1beta may be without effect on NOS2 levels.    Results.    LPS induces NOS2 expression in microglia.  As shown by several groups, incubation of enriched cultures of rat cortical microglial cells with a low dose of LPS (1 ng/ml) led to a time-dependent increase in nitrite accumulation in the cell culture media. This concentration of LPS did not induce significant microglial cell death (assessed by LDH release); nor did higher concentrations of LPS result in significantly higher levels of nitrite production (data not shown). Nitrite levels were undetectable in control samples incubated for up to 24 hr, whereas LPS induced significant nitrite levels at 8 hr and 24 hr (0.49 and 3.9 nmole per 100,000 cells, respectively, Figure XREF_FIG); or approximately 2.1 muM nitrite accumulated per hr per 100,000 cells (10 mug protein). Measurements using the fluorescent reporter H 2 DCF-DA in the presence or absence of a selective NOS2 inhibitor (AMT, 100 muM) showed that NO production could be detected as soon as 4 hr after incubation with LPS and remained relatively unchanged for up to 24 hr incubation                  .    NE inhibits nitrite accumulation and NO production.  Microglia were incubated with LPS and varying concentrations of NE                  . Co-incubation with NE dose-dependently reduced nitrite accumulation (measured after 24 hr incubation), with statistically significant inhibition occurring as low as 0.1 muM NE, and maximal inhibition reaching about 30% at 10 muM NE. Measurements of NO using H 2 DCF-DA showed that NE reduced NOS2-derived NO after 4 hr of incubation, although at this time point significant inhibition was observed only at the higher (10 muM) NE concentration used                  . Measurements of nitrite and nitrate levels                   showed that the ratio of nitrite to nitrate (indicative of chemical breakdown) was unaffected by treatment with NE, ruling out that the reduction of nitrite accumulation due to NE was not due to increased conversion to nitrate.    NE effects are mediated by beta2-ARs and may involve cAMP.  The inhibition of nitrite accumulation by NE was mimicked by the beta-AR agonist isoproterenol used between 0.1 and 10 muM                  , and by the cAMP mimetic dbcAMP                  . The inhibitory effects of NE were not reversed by the alpha-AR antagonist phenoxybenzamine (PB, Figure XREF_FIG) but were completely reverted using either a non-selective beta-AR (propanolol, Figure XREF_FIG) or a selective beta2-AR (ICI-118,551; Figure XREF_FIG) antagonist. Measurements of intracellular cAMP levels confirmed that NE (10 muM) significantly increased (approximately 10-fold versus control cells) cAMP levels between 15 and 60 minutes of incubation (not shown).  Since activation of PKA is mediated by cAMP, we tested a role for PKA in mediating NE inhibitory effects                  . However, co-incubation with the selective PKA inhibitor KT-5720                   or compound H89 which inhibits both PKA and PKC                   did not reverse NE effects, suggesting that PKA activation does not play a major role in reducing NOS2 activity (or expression). Moreover, both inhibitors when used alone reduced nitrite accumulation due to LPS, suggesting that PKA and/or PKC activation may in fact play a role in potentiating microglial NOS2 induction.  To examine a role for cAMP in mediating NE actions, we treated microglia cells with two different AC inhibitors, SQ 22536 (IC 50 = 200 muM) and MDL-12,330A (IC 50 = 250 muM). Unexpectedly, in these cells inhibition of AC activity reduced LPS induced nitrite production                   and NOS2 expression                  , and SQ 22536 further potentiated NE inhibitory effects                  .    NE reduces NOS2 mRNA and increases IkBalpha levels.  Quantitative RT-PCR analysis                   showed that LPS increased NOS2 mRNA steady state levels approximately 15-fold versus control values after 4 hr of incubation, and further increased levels (to roughly 50-fold control levels) at 24 hr incubation. The presence of NE reduced the increase in NOS2 mRNA levels at both 4 and 24 hr, suggesting an effect of NE at the transcriptional and or post-transcriptional level.  In astrocytes, the suppression of NOS2 by NE involves modulation of the NFkappaB:IkappaB signaling system [XREF_BIBR]. In microglia, nitrite production was also dependent upon NFkappaB activation, since treatment with the NFkappaB inhibitor ZIE dose-dependently reduced nitrite accumulation                  . ZIE is a highly selective inhibitor of the 26S proteasome which blocks IkappaBalpha degradation and NFkappaB translocation into the nucleus [XREF_BIBR]. In fact LPS induced a rapid loss of inhibitory IkappaBalpha protein                  , which is affected by NE treatment. In the presence of NE, the reduction in IkappaBalpha protein levels occurring after 30 minutes incubation was less than that in control cells, while after 90 minutes NE caused an increase in IkappaBalpha levels. This suggests that, similar to what is observed in astrocytes [XREF_BIBR], NE may increase IkappaBalpha re-synthesis.    NE reduces IL-1beta release.  As previously reported [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR], LPS increased microglia IL-1beta production                  . As for nitrite production, co-incubation with NE (10 muM) reduced IL-1beta release; however the magnitude of suppression was greater (approximately 80% inhibition) than the 30% suppression of nitrites observed. Incubation of cells with NE alone led to a small but non-significant IL-1beta release after 7 hr. In contrast to nitrite reduction, maximal effects of NE on IL-1beta levels were observed even at the lowest concentration (0.1 muM) tested                  .    Effects of blocking IL-1beta production on NOS2 expression.  The above results suggested a link between microglial NOS2 expression and IL-1beta production. However, incubation with a caspase-1 inhibitor                   reduced IL-1beta production by 33%                   but had no effect on NO production                  . Results using the IL-1ra were conflicting, since although we found a reduction (24%) of LPS-induced nitrite accumulation at the highest concentration tested (100 ng/mL), we found an increase (between 24-33%) at lower concentrations (10-30 ng/mL; data not shown). To further test an involvement of IL-1beta in the induction of NOS2 by LPS, we used microglial cells derived from caspase-1 deficient mice which cannot produce the mature form of IL-1beta. In these cells, LPS (10-1000 ng/ml) induced similar levels of nitrite production as did wild type cells; and the inhibitory effects of NE were maintained both at the highest concentration of LPS                   and at the lower ones (not shown). Together, these results suggest that the inhibition by NE is not primarily mediated via effects on IL-1beta production.    Discussion.  Consistent with previous reports, in the present study we show that rat cortical microglia can be activated in vitro by low doses of LPS leading to NOS2 expression, NO production and nitrite accumulation. Under our experimental conditions, co-incubation with NE (0.1-10 muM) inhibited LPS-dependent NOS2 expression and NO and nitrite production, via activation of beta2-ARs most likely mediated by elevation of intracellular cAMP. Although NE has a high affinity for, and at low doses (100 nM to 1 muM) can increase cAMP via microglial beta1 and beta3 ARs, even greater increases in cAMP were found at higher (1-10 muM) NE concentrations which are needed to activate beta2-ARs [XREF_BIBR]. Thus, the amounts of NE needed to reduce NOS2 expression may reflect a requirement to activate beta2-ARs in our studies, although other non-receptor mediated effects cannot be ruled out. Previous studies of adrenergic regulation of microglial NOS2 are limited: isoproterenol decreased NO release [XREF_BIBR]; and in one study [XREF_BIBR], NE, terbutaline (a beta2-AR agonist), dobutamine (a beta1-AR agonist) as well as phenylephrine (an alpha1-AR agonist) all reduced NO production despite different effects on cAMP elevation; suggesting that adrenergic stimulation can attenuate NOS2 irrespective of effects on cAMP.  Our results are consistent with several reports showing that intracellular levels of cAMP modulate microglial NOS2 expression. NOS2 expression was reduced by cAMP analogs in microglia [XREF_BIBR]; by PGE2 (as well as FSK and dbcAMP) in enriched microglia [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR]; and in mixed neuron:microglial co-cultures [XREF_BIBR]. Microglial NOS2 was also reduced by treatment with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR]; as well as other agents which increase cAMP, including melanocortin peptides [XREF_BIBR], and conditioned media from T. gondii infected astrocytes [XREF_BIBR]. However, NOS2 is not always suppressed by elevated cAMP, and there are several studies showing that in contrast to being inhibitory, cAMP potentiates NOS2 expression [XREF_BIBR]. For example, dbcAMP or IBMX treatment increased microglial NOS2 expression and activity due to Abeta [XREF_BIBR]. The potentiating effects of cAMP appear to be mediated through activation of C/EBP family proteins which can be stimulatory [XREF_BIBR], rather than through activation of CREB proteins which may be inhibitory [XREF_BIBR]; and in macrophages may include activation of other kinases including PKC isoforms and p38 MAPK [XREF_BIBR]. Hence, activation of distinct cAMP-dependent transcription factors could account for observation of both activation as well as suppression by cAMP in microglial cells.  It should be pointed out that studies using dbcAMP should be interpreted cautiously since dbcAMP must first be metabolized to its active form, monobutyryl cAMP, a reaction catalyzed by intracellular esterases as well as extracellularly in the presence of serum, and that also releases the butyryl group from the 5'-position. The anti-inflammatory effects of dbcAMP on NO production could therefore be due, in part, to production of sodium butyrate which in rat primary microglial cells can reduce NO production and IL6 and TNFalpha release [XREF_BIBR]. Nevertheless, findings that the effects of NE are mediated via beta2-ARs which primarily increase intracellular cAMP, and also are mimicked using the betaAR agonist isoproterenol are consistent with the idea that NE actions involve increases in cAMP.  Although PKA is a primary target for activation by cAMP, we found that selective PKA inhibitors did not reverse the inhibitory effects of NE, suggesting that other cAMP-dependent signaling pathways, such as the newly characterized EPAC/RAP system [XREF_BIBR] may mediate NE inhibitory actions in microglia. However interpretation of results with PKA inhibitors are complicated by the fact that these inhibitors blocked LPS-dependent nitrite production                  , suggesting a role for PKA activation in NOS2 induction.  Similarly, our results show that the AC inhibitor SQ22536 did not reverse NE actions, and by itself reduced LPS-induced NOS2 activity and expression                  . This finding is in contrast with previous studies showing no effects of this agent (or other AC inhibitors) on NOS2 induction, yet able to reverse NOS2 suppression due to activation of the prostaglandin EP2 receptors by PGE2 [XREF_BIBR]. However, in the same study contradictory effects of AC activation on NOS2 were observed, since sulprostone, a potent agonist for the EP1 and EP3 receptors which inhibits AC activity, inhibited LPS-induced nitrite production; furthermore nitrite production was also increased at the higher concentrations of isoproterenol (>100 nM), the AC activator forskolin (FSK, > 100 muM) and dbcAMP (>10 muM). AC activators also had contrasting effects on Abeta induced nitrite production in microglia, where low doses of forskolin (10 to 50 muM) increased NO release, and a higher dose (100 muM) reduced NO release [XREF_BIBR]. An understanding of the contrasting effects of PKA and AC inhibitors on nitrite production and NOS2 expression may therefore help to explain reported divergent effects of cAMP on microglial NOS2.  The effects of increasing cAMP levels on microglial IL-1beta production and expression are also conflicting. Thus, Si et al. [XREF_BIBR] showed that the PDE inhibitor propentofylline reduced LPS induced TNFalpha and IL-1beta release; Caggiano and Kraig [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR] showed that PGE2 acting via EP2 receptors (and increased cAMP) reduced IL-1beta production; and Cho et al. [XREF_BIBR] showed that the dopamine metabolite NAMDA which increases cAMP and CREB activation reduced IL-1beta mRNA levels. In contrast, Hetier [XREF_BIBR] found that the beta-AR agonist isoproterenol reduced LPS induced IL-1beta as well as TNFalpha production, however while TNFalpha mRNA was reduced, IL-1beta mRNA was increased. Tomozawa et al. [XREF_BIBR] similarly found that isoproterenol (and dbcAMP) increased IL-1beta mRNA in microglial (although not in astrocytes); and Petrova et al. [XREF_BIBR] reported that PGE2 also reduced IL-1beta secretion, but increased IL-1beta mRNA levels. More recently, Woo et al [XREF_BIBR] showed that dbcAMP reduced TNFalpha expression, but increased IL-1beta expression in BV2 cells; and Tanaka et al. [XREF_BIBR] showed in that various beta1- and beta2-AR agonists alone could increase IL-1beta mRNA levels in rat microglia. Our data is therefore the first to demonstrate the effects of an endogenous neurotransmitter on NOS2 expression and IL-1beta levels in stimulated microglial cells.  The suppression by NE of IL-1beta production was similar to that seen for NOS2, which suggested that the ability of NE to reduce NOS2 may be related to its ability to reduce IL-1beta. However, several features suggest that these may be independent events. Thus, in contrast to suppression of NOS2, the effects of NE on IL-1beta were observed at concentrations lower than that needed for maximal inhibition of NOS2 expression, and resulted in greater extent of inhibition (over 80% inhibition of IL-1beta versus 30% of NO or nitrite production). Furthermore, NE was able to reduce nitrite production in caspase-1 deficient cells                   demonstrating that effects of NE on IL-1beta are not necessary to observe effects on NOS2. Several previous reports suggest distinct regulation of microglial NOS2 and IL-1beta. Thus, microglial cells cultured in the presence of astrocytes lost their ability to produce NOS2 in response to LPS, although their IL-1beta release was unaffected [XREF_BIBR]. Petrova et al. [XREF_BIBR] and Si et al. [XREF_BIBR] showed cAMP dependent reductions in IL-1beta production with no effect on NO production; and Woo et al [XREF_BIBR] showed increased IL-1beta expression due to dbcAMP with no effect on NO production. More recently, treatment of LPS activated microglia with malonic acid C60 derivatives reduced NOS2 mRNA expression, although these same reagents increased the release of IL-1beta [XREF_BIBR]. From these studies, it is clear that there is no necessary concordance between the regulation of IL-1beta expression (or production) and that of NOS2 expression (or activity).  In general, the role that IL-1beta plays in inducing glial (astrocytes or microglial) NOS2 is not clear. In astrocytes, IL-1beta in combination with other cytokines (IFNgamma and/or TNFalpha) can induce rodent NOS2 [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR], and a few reports suggest that IL-1beta alone may induce rodent astrocyte NOS2 [XREF_BIBR]. In contrast, in human fetal and adult astrocytes, IL-1beta alone can induce NOS2 [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR] which is greatly increased by other cytokines [XREF_BIBR]. Although astrocyte NOS2 induction can, in some cases, be reduced by treatment with IL-ra (hypoxia, [XREF_BIBR]; using CM obtained from Gp41 activated of microglia, [XREF_BIBR]; using Abeta stimulation, [XREF_BIBR]) it is likely that other factor(s) are released which contribute to NOS2 induction. In contrast to astrocytes, there are no clear reports to indicate that IL-1beta alone will induce microglial NOS2, and in fact human microglial appear more refractory to NOS2 inducers than do rodent cells [XREF_BIBR]. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that the LPS induced IL-1beta does not play an important role in mediating microglial NOS2 expression.  The molecular mechanism(s) by which NE reduces microglial NOS2 expression and IL-1beta production and expression are not yet known. Work from several laboratories has shown in glial cells that LPS rapidly activates PK cascades which lead to phosphorylation of inhibitory IkappaB proteins, their degradation by the 26S proteasome, and subsequent activation of NFkappaB [XREF_BIBR], necessary for the expression of pro-inflammatory genes [XREF_BIBR]. We observed that LPS induced rapid loss of the microglial IkappaBalpha protein, while co-incubation with NE reduced that loss and moreover increased IkappaBalpha levels after longer times. Several reports suggest that increases in cAMP are associated with increased levels of IkappaBalpha [XREF_BIBR-XREF_BIBR], and we demonstrated that NE directly increases transcription of the IkappaBalpha gene in astrocytes and reduces the overall magnitude of IkBa degradation [XREF_BIBR]. Taken together these data suggest that the inhibitory effects of NE in microglia may also be mediated in part by interference with the NFkB:IkB signaling pathway.  The in vivo relevance of noradrenergic regulation of inflammatory gene expression, is suggested by observations that the noradrenergic neurons of the LC are damaged or lost in AD [XREF_BIBR], leading to a loss (or at least a transient loss) in noradrenergic signaling within projection areas. A possible perturbation in noradrenergic signaling is also implicated in MS, since it has been shown that treatment with beta-AR agonists [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR] can provide protection in animal models of MS, and more recently that the levels of beta2-ARs in astrocytes are decreased in MS patients as compared to healthy controls [XREF_BIBR]. We recently demonstrated that LC loss increases both the magnitude as well as the duration of the inflammatory responses in vivo including the extent of microglia activation [XREF_BIBR]. Furthermore, we showed that central NE depletion led to a dramatic decrease in cortical levels of the IkBa protein, consistent with the idea that NE normally keeps the IkBa gene transcriptionally active [XREF_BIBR]. Together with the knowledge that IL-1beta plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD [XREF_BIBR], and in view of the fact that microglial NOS2 expression is implicated in the damage occurring in MS [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR], AD [XREF_BIBR] and cerebral ischemia [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR], it may be of value to consider possible therapeutic strategies to increase microglial beta-AR activation or intracellular cAMP levels.
